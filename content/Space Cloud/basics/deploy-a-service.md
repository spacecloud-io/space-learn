Not everything can be achieved by CRUD operations. Sometimes we need to write some backend code to get some work done.

In this guide, we will:

- Deploy a dockerized app on Space Cloud.
- Expose the APIs of the REST service to the outside world by setting up `Space Cloud Routes`.

> **Note:** Make sure you have followed the [Setup Space Cloud](/space-cloud/basics/setup) guide in the `Space Cloud Basics` track. We'll be building up from there.

## Advantage of deploying with Space Cloud
When running on Kubernetes, Space Cloud gives you the following benefits:

- Complete end to end encryption.
- Advanced deployment patterns like Blue/Green Deployment, A/B Tests, etc.
- Advanced service to service authentication policies.
- Autoscaling including scaling down to zero.

## What are we going to deploy

We'll set up a simple HTTP server which has the following:

- An endpoint to add two numbers.
- An endpoint to double the number provided.

Following are the endpoints of our REST service:

<br>

| Method | URL                | Request Body                     | Response Body        |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| `GET`  | `/add/:num1/:num2` | N/A                              | `{"value": RESULT }` |
| `POST` | `/double`          | `{"value": VALUE_TO_BE_DOUBLED}` | `{"value": RESULT }` |
| `POST` | `/logger`          | `ANY JSON OBJECT`                | `{}`                 |

## Deploying the service

Space Cloud can deploy only docker containers as of now. So we need to dockerize our app. To speed things up, we will deploy a pre-built image.

Open `Microservices` > `Deployments` and hit the `Deploy your first container` button.

Our `Service ID` will be `myapp` and the `Version` will be `v1`.

Now hit `Add Task` to add a container to our deployment. This is where we configure container level properties like _docker image_, _resource constraints_, etc.

Let the `Task ID` be `myapp` and `Docker container` be `spaceuptech/basic-service`. Also add a HTTP port `8080`.

Finally hit `Save` and watch our service get deployed.

> **It can take upto a minute or so for a service to get deployed.**

Hurray! We just deployed a dockerized REST service using Space Cloud. I know you want to celebrate, but let's wait a min before we do that.

## Verify the deployment

Checkout to the `Overview` tab of `Deployments` section in Mission Control and hit **refresh**. You should be able to see the service we just deployed like this:

Yess! Now you can celebrate! You deserve it for following this track so diligently.ðŸ˜›

## Expose your API

Currently, the REST service we deployed is accessible from within the cluster only. We need to add `Space Cloud Routes` to expose our service to the outside world.

Let's head over to the `Ingress Routing` section in the `Microservices` tab in `Mission Control`. 

Hit `Create your first route` to open the following form:

![Routing Form](/images/screenshots/add-ingress-routing-rule.png)

We'll simply redirect all non Space Cloud traffic to our service for now.

You'll need to provide the following details in the form:

| Route Matching Type | Prefix |
|---------------------|--------|
| `Prefix Match`      | `/`    |

Targets:

| Scheme | Service Host                        | Port | Weight |
|--------|-------------------------------------|------|--------|
| `HTTP` | `myapp.myproject.svc.cluster.local` | 8080 | 100    |

Once you are done, hit `Add`.

To verify that our REST service is exposed, simply open another tab in your browser and enter:
```bash
http://localhost/add/1/2
```

> **You may have to use `http://localhost:4122/add/1/2` depending on how you are running Space Cloud**

You should be able to see the following response on your screen:
{{< highlight json >}}
{
  "value": 3
}
{{< /highlight >}}

## Next steps

Awesome! We just deployed and exposed our first REST service!!!

There is a lot more we can do with `Deployments`. Space Cloud has amazing features like _autoscaling_, _service communication policies_, _secret management_, etc. built into it. Don't worry, we'll be covering all of these in another guide.

Continue to the next guide to create a GraphQL API on top of our service.
